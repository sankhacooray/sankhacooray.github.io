                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. I 
                    encourage all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through 
                    the Application and/or Services.
                    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
                    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
                    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
